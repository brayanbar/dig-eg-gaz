ISAM AND KAISER.
MOTIVES FOR MEETING.
London, July 25.
There are endless theories as to the motives
of the Imperial meeting, from the, natural
desire of the Sovereigns to discuss the political
problems confronting Europe, to the design of
the German Emperor to combine Germany,
Russia and France against Japan in view of
the peace negotiations.	(Reuter.)
ST. PETERSBURG, July 25.
The Tsar has returned to Peterhof. (Reuter.)

OPPOSITION FIGHT.
London, July 25.
The Unionist organs approve of Mr. Balfour's
decision to remain in office, deeming it right
that his personal feelings should give way
before national considerations. The Radicals
denounce the Government for clinging to office.

NEW WAY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS - A
Roumanian woman who owed a sum of money
to a man who pressed her for payment,
attempted to commit suicide yesterday by
taking poison. Her life was, however, saved.
SUEZ CANAL.—22 vessels passed through
the Canal on the 22nd and 23rd inst, 13 of
which were British, 5 German, 1 French, 1
Dutch, 1 Austrian, 1 Egyptian. The receipts
for the two days were frs. 664,677.92, making
the total from the 1st inst. fr. 6,511,506.14.
THE PLAGUE. —Yesterday’s bulletin records
two cases (one fatal) and two recoveries at
Alexandria. The patient admitted to hospital
is an Italian joiner living in Anastassi-street,
while the fatal case was that of a native servant,
who was a relative of the man found dead on
the 23rd inst.
CAIRO TRAMWAYS.—It is stated that an
agreement has been com0 to between the
Public Works Department and the Cairo Tram-
way Company for an extension of the life of
the latter by five years, so that all the com-
pany’s material, as well as the lands bought
and buildings constructed, will not become the
property of the Government till the year
1951.
MR. LYNN’S CASE.— The General Orders
issued by the Ministry of the Interior an-
nounce that Saghcolaghasi J. Lynn, moawin of
police, Alexandria City, has resigned his ap-
pointment, and has been struck off the strength
of the police, with effect from yesterday’s date.
We understand that the Alexandria Muni-
cipality will in all probability take into account
the excellent services which Captain Lynn has
rendered to the city, and in likewise accepting
his resignation will grant him a gratuity.
ROYAL BERKS.—The warrant officers, staff
sergeants, and sergeants of the 2nd Battalion
Royal Berkshire Regiment gave a quadrille
party in their mess-room at Mustapha Pasha
yesterday evening, to commemorate the anni-
versary of the Battle of Maiwand, in which that
regiment took a conspicuous part. The floor
of the mess-room, gaily decorated for the
occasion, was in excellent condition, and to
the strains of the string band of the regiment
dancing was indulged in with the greatest zest
until an advanced hour this morning. There
were a large number of guests, including
several officers of the regiment, and the general
hosts were indefatigable in their attentions to
all. A well-stocked buffet was provided and
done ample justice to.
ST. ANDREW’S GIRLS’ UPPER SCHOOL.—The
exhibition and prize-giving took place in this
school yesterday in the presence of a large
gathering of parents and friends. Mr. Vice-
Consul Freeman occupied the chair. An Eng-
lish cantata, "Festival of the Flowers,” in
which each pupil represented a different flower,
was much appreciated. The choral singing,
duets, and solos were beautifully rendered, and
the various "flowers" acted their parts to
perfection. The French pieces, La Sonambula
and Froufrou, were also of an excellent order,
and reflect the highest credit on M. Coupson,
French master. Other items on the programme
were an Arabic recitation and an English piece
by the junior pupils. The duties of accompanist
were excellently performed by Miss M. Gatt.
Towards the end of the programme the prizes
were presented to successful pupils by Mrs.
Freeman, whose first public appearance it was.
Among the prize-winners we especially noticed
Miss E. Samama, who, besides several other
prizes, gained a handsome medal for Scripture,
presented by Major Allan of Glasgow. Next in
order of merit came Misses Jacobson and
Youameidis. Thereafter Mr. Freeman, in a few
well-chosen remarks, congratulated Miss
Hannah, M.A., head mistress, her efficient
staff, and the pupils themselves, on the suc
cessful work done daring the session, and
invited the audience to inspect the needlework,
drawing, painting, and kindergarten in the
adjoining room. This exhibition also showed
wonderful efficiency in these branches of school
work. At the conclusion of the entertainment
Rev. H. P. Reid proposed a hearty vote of
thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Freeman for their
presence on this occasion, which was cordially
responded to.

FIGHTING THE COTON WORM
SUCCESS OF MEASURES.
The energetic measures which have been
taken by the Ministry of the Interior to
combat the cotton worm and to check as far
as possible the damage which it causes to the
cotton crops, are proving very successful, as
the considerable decrease in the area attacked
during last week amply demonstrates. The
first brood which appeared in June has been
dealt with, that of July is at present being
actively dealt with and has to a large extent
been destroyed, and the workers are now
busily seeking for the eggs of the third or
August brood, which in previous years has
always proved to be the largest and has
caused most damage. We understand, however,
that the work of the last two months has
been so effective that the third brood will, in
all probability, be very slight, and that there
is very little fear of the worms appearing in
large numbers.
In connection with this work, we might
mention that Mr. Machell has not yet fixed
the date when he will go on leave, but is
waiting until be can be certain that there will
be no re-appearance of the worm this season,
when the work will be practically completed.
Mr. Machell has shown himself indefatig-
able in the way he has organised and super-
intended the work for the destruction of the
worm, and in his personal inspection of the
work done in those cultivations which have
suffered more severely than others.

QUARANTINE IN GREECE.
The following telegram has been received
from Athens by the Hellenic sanitary delegate
on the Quarantine Board :—
"Arrivals from Alexandria and Adalia sub-
jected 48 hours’ quarantine, also medical
inspection from the littorals Syria and Asia
Minor, Port Ptolemais as far as Adalia,
excepting Adalia, thence as far as Smyrna,
excepting Smyrna.”

ALEXANDRIA BRIDGES.
We hear that the special committee, con-
sisting of Mr. Chataway, representing the Mu-
nicipality, Mr. Williams and Mr. Acres, repre-
senting the Irrigation Department and the
Railway Administration respectively, Mr. S..H.
Carver, representing the Alexandria General
Produce Association, and Mr. L. Stagni, repre-
senting the importers, have drawn up a report
on the increase of the number of bridges on the
Mahmondieh Canal.
The committee consider it impossible to
enlarge the existing bridges and recommend
the construction of a new bridge linking the
Sharia Shoanah el Tainat with the rue du
Canal Mahmondieh, east of the Fire Station.
They have also decided to consider the con-
struction of a new bridge nearly opposite the
rue Tewfikieh, and to replace the Ibrahim
Bridge by a new bridge of greater width, the
details of which will be settled as soon as the
new bridge is completed. In view of the con-
fusion prevalent with regard to the name of
the bridge below the Ibrahim Bridge it was de-
cided to rename it the Daira Sanieh Bridge.
The new bridge will be called the Abbas
Bridge.
The Municipality has expressed its agree-
ment in principle with the conclusions of the
committee and has decided to submit them to
the Government

EGYPTIAN MINING.
In its Mining article, the "Financier" of
the 17th inst says Elsewhere, however,
more bullish views were held, significance
being attached to the strong buying of Egyp-
tians which took place last week. It is thought,
in fact, that another effort is on the tapis for
bringing Egyptian mining enterprises into
public favor. The last move in this direc-
tion, it may perhaps be remembered, was
hopelessly baulked by the turbulent condition
of politics, and since then, in company with
Kaffirs, prices have gradually dwindled down
to what can now only be described as bed-
rock level. Now, with the political outlook
comparatively dear, and the speculating public
sorely in need of a new area wherein, so to
speak, they can have a good run for their
money, it is thought the attractions of Egyp-
tians are bound to claim attention. It is on
this assumption, at any rate, that astute and
influential people have been quietly acquiring
lines of the leading Egyptian stocks—witness
the sharp advance which occurred the other
day in Egyptian Mines—and equally good,
too, was the buying of such shares as Nile
Valley, Um Rus, Central Egypts and Egyptian
Options, as well as several of the Trust com-
panies. An indication of how mining develop-
ments are proceeding space is contained in
the circular to hand from the Mysore Reefs
Company, which in the autumn is forming
two exploratory parties for the purpose of
prospecting ancient mining sites in Egypt and
the Sudan. This company and the Egyptian
Mines, it might be mentioned, are big holders
in the prosperous Um Rus. Generally speak-
ing, the outlook for Egyptians is regarded as
distinctly favorable, and the opinion is
strongly held that the next wave of specula-
tion in mines will turn in this direction.

NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
SIR H. PINCHING’S DEPARTURE.
(From our Correspondent).
Port Said, Tuesday.
Sir Horace Pinching, K.C.M.G., Director-
General of the Sanitary Department, left here
by the Messegeries SS. Ville de la Ciotat
after a short stay at the Eastern Exchange.
He goes to Marseilles and thence to England.

BAD WEATHER REPORTED.
The Ville de la Ciotat, during her passage
through the Arabian Sea, experienced some
very bad weather and has lost her foremast
and a quantity of deck furniture.
The B. I. Mombassa, which arrived here
from the Canal this morning, reports an
exceedingly heavy monsoon. To the north-
ward of Socotra she experienced but little sea,
but for some hours was in the thick of a lull
gale of wind which did some damage about
the decks.

EASTERN COASTING TRADE.
The Eastern coasts trade seems to be on the
increase of late. Counting the two vessels
which have arrived from Hamburg and Liver-
pool respectively to-day, one of the Admiral
class of the Hamburg-Amerika line and the
Kohinur, of the Asiatic (Turner Morrison)
Line, no less than nine ships have passed
through on their maiden voyages for the coast
trades of China and India this month. These
vessels, — as does the Qaeda, the leviathan
12,000-ton ship which I referred to last
week, — will most likely never return to the
"land of their birth” but will remain per-
manently on the coasts for which they are
destined. The Hamburg-Amerika Line has a
somewhat large fleet on the China coast
running in opposition to the China merchants
and two large British-owned lines sailing from
Shanghai.

THE EASTERN EXCHANGE
Considerable improvements are now taking
place in and around the Eastern Exchange.
Some time back, I understand, the proprietors
purchased a large piece of the adjacent land,
which, if built on, would have much affected
the value of the building. The greater part of
this piece of ground is now being cleared and
a small garden is to be there planted and
arranged, and I hear, later on, is to be greatly
enlarged.

SINKING OF THE CONGAL
Two engineer surveyors have been out here
during the last few days on behalf of the
underwriters of the Congal and the owners of
the Craftsman. These gentlemen have just
completed-their surveys and the result will
probably, determine the value of the work of
her salving due to the Canal Company. It is
said the award will probably only be the
payment of out-of- pocket expenses.

PRIMARY CERTIFICATE
EXAMINATION.
Monday's "Official Journal” contains a long
list of the successful candidates in the Primary
Certificate examination. Out of 3,333 can-
didates 1,173 passed the examination with
success.Of the total of the successful candidates
1,111 had taken the English and 62 the French
course.
The successful candidates have been grouped
in two divisions. The first division includes
all who obtained 75 % or more of the maximum
number of marks obtainable, who number 180.
The first name on this list is that of Nessim
Abd-el Sayed, of the Bab el Charieh Sobool,
who obtained 140 1/4 marks out of 160, his
average being high all through. Hamid Ahmed,
of the El-Tahdirieh School, is second on the
list with 136 3/4, and eleven other candidates
have obtained over 180 marks. We notice that
the 12 candidates on the French side who
obtained marks justifying their inclusion in
the first division show a higher average in
their marks for French than the pupils who
took the English coarse obtained for English.
Twenty girls entered for the examination, of
whom 10 passed. The Government schools
sent up 556 boys who took the English course
and 9 girls, one only boy taking the French
course. From the free schools 497 boys and 1
girl entered on the English side, and 53 boys
on the French. 48 private pupils took up Eng-
lish and 8 French—all boys.
We wonder would it be possible for the
Ministry of Public Instruction to publish, with
the lists, the religion and origin of the pupils
entering for the examination. Statistics showing
tbh proportion of Syrian, Copt, and Israelite
candidates would be of considerable interest to
the public.

JUDICIAL NEWS.
It is reported that there is a distinct pos-
sibility that the finding of the Court of Appeal
in the Riffahi ease may not be maintained by
the Court of Cassation, on the ground that
three days’ evidence was not given to the
accused, and that a new trial may be neces-
sary. The Court of Cassation will hear the case
on August 1.
Another interesting case, that of Androus
Meloka, will come before the Cairo Assize
Court on August 12.
The Léon Fehmy case will be heard at the
same session of the Court


NOTES FROM SUAKIN.
DRURY BEY’S TRANSFER.
(From our Correspondent.)
Suakin, July 19.
In my last notes I made mention of the
transfer of Kaimakam Drury Bey, R.N., Con-
troller of Sudan Ports, to the Bahr el Ghazal,
but this move has now been cancelled owing to
the death of Kaimakam Fell Bey, R.N., who
was to have relieved Drury Bey.

THE WEATHER.
The weather is still very hot and khamseen
winds continue to prevail. The thermometer
in the shade is sometimes as high as 110* F.

SPORT AT SUAKIN.
The members of the British Railway Em-
ployés’ Mess held a pigeon match on the sea
front at Quarantine Camp on Friday, the 14th
inst. There was a very strong wind blowing
from the north, which rather upset some of the
guns, and got worse towards the close of the
day. Mr. Claude S. Archer made very good
scoring, taking 10 birds out of a possible 11,
and thus securing the two most important
events of the day. Mr. Archer was hard
pressed, however, by Mr. Gaiger, who was one
bird only to the bad, Lost by an unlucky bird
falling a few feet outside the line. Mr. Hodges,
under very trying circumstances, won the 3rd
event. There was a very large attendance and
a very enjoyable afternoon was spent.

TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT.
Mr. Albert Cree, of Alexandria, Inspector of
Traffic, Suakin-Atbara Railways, has resigned
his appointment after two months' service, Mr.
Cree is the third English inspector of traffic ;
the two before him also resigned with less than
three months’ service. Mr. Cree leaves Suakin
to day for Suez and Alexandria by the Khédi-
vial mail steamer Dakahlieh.

FEVER.
Very few cases of fever exist now. Mr. W. H.
Bailey, Inspector of Bridges, who was laid up in
hospital with it, has now completely recovered
and resumed his duties. Kaimakam Mohamed
Bey Ahmed, Commandant, Suakin Police, has
also recovered from his late illness and resumed
his’ duties.

SUAKIN MOUDIRIEH
The acting Moudir, Mr. Kerr, and the whole
mondirieh staff have gone to Erkoweit for the
summer months.
