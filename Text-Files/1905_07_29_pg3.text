the beach opposite the Gouvernorat. The police
are making the usual enquiries.
FATAL FALL.—A Berberin boy, aged 12
years, fell off a roof on which he was playing
into Cherif Pasha-street yesterday and was
killed on the spot. The body has been taken to
hospital.
THE THEFT FROM THE S.S. ASSOUAN. — We
are informed that the arrest of the author of
the theft of £1,000 from the S.S. Assouan is
imminent. The losses are entirely covered by
insurance.
SUEZ CANAL.—13 vessels passed through
the Canal on the 26th inst., of which 7 were
British, 3 German, 1 Turkish, 2 Dutch. The
receipts for the day were frs. 380,437.90,
making the total from the 1st inst. frs.
7,503,888.45.
ALHAMBRA THEATRE.— There was a large
audience last night at the premiere of the new
comedy written by M. George Ralli, the well-
known local author. The piece, which is
entitled Les Surprises de l’Héritage, met with
considerable success.
COAL IMPORTS.—From the 1st of January

shire 30,988, and other places 19,968 tons.
During the same period of last year 551,030
tons were received.
A RECALCITRANT FATHER.—We are inform-
ed that on Thursday a dog, believed to be mad,
bit a girl of 13, named Maria Sayed Hassan,

gestion made by the police that she should be
immediately taken to hospital for treatment
The police communicated with the British
Consulate, which immediately informed the
father that he must at once comply with the
proposal of the police, and allow his daughter
to be treated.
ANOTHER EGYPTIAN ARRESTED IN SYRIA.—
We are informed that Mustafa Efiendi
Nafih, the editor of a Tantah contemporary,
was recently arrested at Beyrout, where he
had arrived en route for the Lebanon. Our
unfortunate confrère was accused of (1)
agitating for the revival of the Arab Caliphate;
(2) being an agent of the Young Turkish
Party, and we have no doubt that, had the
Ottoman authorities and their informer in
Egypt only thought of it, he would have been
accused of blasphemy against the Prophet or
of a plot to steal the Black Stone itself After
keeping their prisoner in an uncomfortable
gaol for some days, the police, being unable to
discover any proof of his complicity in any
plot, let him go free with a warning to be very
careful in future.

TRADE OF EGYPT.
CUSTOMS RETURNS FOR JUNE.
The Customs returns for June, 1905, have
just been published. The statistics of the im-
ports and exports recorded at the five custom-
houses of Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, Da-
mietta, and Kosseir, show that the total value
of the imports of last month amounted to
L.E. 1,452,898, against L E. 1,427,029 in the
corresponding month of the previous year,
while the export totals showed a very large
increase, L.E. 1,316,611 against L.E. 998,088
in 1904, an increase of L.E. 318,693.
Taking the figures for the first six months
of the present year we find that the total
value of the imports reached L.E. 9,427,286,
against L.E. 8,680,095 during the correspond-
ing months of 1904, showing the large increase
of L.E. 747,191. This increase is more than
balanced by the falling off in exports, the
figures for the first half of the present year
being L.E. 9,609,952, against L.E. 11,055,749
in the first half of 1904, a difference of L.E.
1,445,797 in favor of the corresponding
period of the past year.
British imports, in which we include imports
from the Mediterranean possessions of Great
Britain, amount to L.E. 506,446, including
tobacco, against L.E. 452,275 in June, 1904,
giving the gratifying increase of L.E. 54,171,
while the exports amount to L.E. 512,485 in
value, against L.E. 470,650 in June, 1904.
During the first six months, January to
June inclusive, of 1905, imports from Great
Britain reached a total value of L.E. 8,234,204,
an increase of L.E. 235,132 on the figures
for the corresponding period in 1904, but the
decrease in exports to Great Britain is even
more marked, amounting as it does to L.E.
701,342. In comparing the import figures of
the various Powers which have important
commercial relations with Egypt we notice a
considerable increase in British imports both
during the past month and in the first six
months of the year. As for the other Powers,
their import figures show a slight decrease
for June, 1905, in the case of Germany, Aus-
tria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey, an increase
of over 12% in the case of Italy, and slightly
improved figures for America, Belgium, France,
and Greece. For the first six months of the
year imports showed increases in almost every
case, the figures for France, L.E. 1,025,631
against L.E. 849,939 in the period January 1—
June 30, 1904, showing the most remarkable
growth.
The increase of exports daring the past
month is well marked in the case of England
(+ LE. 41.784). Germany (+L.E. 59,556),
France, America, and Austria-Hungary. Recent
events in the Black Sea have no doubt caused
the decrease in Russian exports and imports in
June. In the first six months of 1905 England
comes first in the export list, followed by
Germany and France, in the order given, but
Turkey is the only country having important
commercial relations with Egypt, the exports
to which during the above period of 1905
exceed those of the corresponding period of 1904.

NILE NAVIGATION.
Although nothing definite has been decided
with regard to the rumored amalgamation of
the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel
Company with the Hamburg-Amerika Line,
we have reason to believe that there is every
probability that the fusion will be carried
through.
The former company was approached by the
latter on the subject in May last, and it was
arranged that the directors of the two com-
panies should meet either in Paris or Hamburg.
So far, however, no report of any meeting has
as yet reached Cairo. All the Anglo-American
directors are at present absent in Europe.

RAS EL BAR.
A Ras el Bar correspondent writes : —The
steamer, which is under contract to carry
the mails, was last year timed to leave Ras
el-Bar at 11 a.m., reaching Damietta a little
after 12 noon. This year the steamer leaves
Ras el-Bar at 8 a.m., reaches Damietta a little
after 9, and passengers who intend leaving
for Cairo, Alexandria, and other places have
to wait till 1.25 p.m., the time the first train
leaves after 7 a.m. On enquiry it will be found
that the Governor of Damietta has made
an arrangement with the owner of the steamer
to leave Ras el-Bar at 8 a.m. (He is staying
there with his family and he has to be at
his Damietta office at 9 a.m.) The con-
sequence is that the public is put to great
inconvenience.

NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
BACK FROM THE WAR.
(From our Correspondent).
Port Said, Friday.
Yesterday, the British steamer Whampca,
chartered by the Russian authorities as a
hospital ship, arrived from the East, having
on board 160 sick and wounded. The whole
of this number were in various stages of
insanity, some dangerous and in cells, others
with merely slight attacks of mental aberration.
On the upper deck were built two large steel
wire cages, in which, quite open as they were
to the gaze of the curious, could be counted
between 60 and 70 poor wretches hanging on
to the bars and staring at passing boats. Not
one of these men but appeared to have been
wounded, and I understand they had all been
attacked with a severe form of fever, brought
on by starvation and innumerable privations,
which was the cause of their insanity. The
vessel sailed for the Black Sea at 10 p.m.

FIRE ON THE MACEDONIA.
The morning after the Macedonia had been
shifted to the petroleum basin, two selected
experts were called to hold a survey and
advise as to the best method of dealing
with the fire on board. The gentlemen ap-
pointed were Comm. Vaquier, of the M. M.
Company here, and an engineer. These
gentlemen at once advised that the hatches
should be opened and that next day
the coal be discharged. The general idea
held here was that this advice was, to say
the least, premature and hardly in agreement
with previous like experiences of fires in coal
cargoes. The usual method is to close up
everything and inject steam or carbonic acid
gas, both-of which processes have had consi-
derable success in Port Said and elsewhere.
The result amply bore out the opinion of
many, for by yesterday afternoon clouds of
smoke were pouring out of the hatchway,
rendering discharge impossible, and soon after
wards things got so bad, that the fire, fed
as it had been by fresh air since the pre-
vious day, had gained such a hold that the
only way left to save the ship was to
flood the hold. Fortunately, the Canal Com-
pany had taken promotions to have the
jumps alongside, and these soon flooded the
hold and thus averted what night have
proved a terrible disaster. The vessel is now
quiet and lieing on the bottom, her deck
line well above water. The water is being
pumped out

CAIRO TRAMWAYS.
We understand that, in connection with the
concession recently granted to the Cairo Tram-
way Company for the extension of their
lines, the company will contribute £40,000
towards the cost of construction of the three
new Nile bridges, and that an extension of
five years has been granted to the company.
As we announced yesterday, the Tramway
Company have informed the Ministry of
Public Works that it is their intention to
provide first class cars on all their lines
from January 1, 1906. Such an innovation
has long been wished for in Cairo, and its
necessity has been greatly felt by a large
number of Cairo residents. At the present
time, first-class cars are only provided on the
line which runs from Kasr el-Nil to the
Pyramids, and though on other lines one
does occasionally meet with compartments
reserved for those desirous of travelling first-
class, these are small, and the heat in them
is so excessive, that it often deters a would-
be passenger from entering them.
We are unaware of the design upon which
these new cars are to be modelled, but the
principal point to which attention should be
paid as regards the comfort of passengers
is that there should be a free circulation
of air, so that the car may be kept compara-
tively cool. If this be the case, if the cars
are comfortable and are kept clean, there
is but little doubt that they will be well-
patronised and that the company will be
well repaid for the extra expenditure.
Whilst we are writing on the subject of Cairo
tramcars we might point out the necessity for
the creation of a bye-law by which somebody
would be held responsible for the over-crowding
of the trams. The Cairo trams are allowed to
become overcrowded to a most dangerous
extent,and numbers of people can often be seen
standing on the footboard, clinging to any
support which they can find. The dislodging of
a person in such a position by a sudden jerk is
very possible and serious injury might follow.
In fact, quite recently a young man travelling
on the footboard of a Rod-el-Farag car fell off
and was killed, and there are every day many
chances of a repetition of such a case. A tram-
car should be licensed to hold a certain number
of people, as in Europe, and the conductor who
is responsible for seeing that this number is
not exceeded should be liable to severe punish-
ment for any infringement.

NOTES FROM SUEZ.
RUSSIAN AUXILIARY CRUISER.
(From our Correspondent.)
Suez, Friday.
As I wired you this forenoon, the Russian
auxiliary cruiser Kuban arrived at Suet this
morning from the Far Bast, and will enter the
Canal at 10 o’clock this evening for Liban.
This huge vessel, formerly a Hamburg-Amerika
passenger steamer, has three funnels with two
low masts, and is fitted with wireless appara-
tus. She flies the naval flag and pennant She
carries several quick-firing guns, similar to
those fitted to other auxiliary cruisers. Her
last victim was the British India steamer
Fazilka, which was stopped by her in the Red
Sea, south of Daedalus lighthouse, last Tues-
day morning. Her papers were overhauled and
on being found in order the vessel was released.
The Fazilka sailed from Suez Last Saturday
bound to Aden, Colombo, Madras, and Calcutta
with general cargo and passengers.

THE CITY OF MANCHESTER
The S.S. City of Manchester, which was
damaged in the Canal last week, has been tem-
porarily repaired at Suez, and sailed last
Thursday for Calcutta, where the repairs will
be completed in dry-dock. She had to discharge
from her foreholds about 600 tons of general
cargo into lighters, which was put back before
she sailed.

SUICIDE IN THE CEMETERY.
This morning the body of a native in a state
of decomposition was found hanging from a
tree in the cemetery. An enquiry has been
opened. It is presumed that the man commit-
ted suicide.

OBITUARY.
E. D. J. DUTILH.
We regret to announce the death, which
occurred last night, of Mr. E. D. J. Dutilh,
conservator of the numismatic section of
the Greco-Roman Museum at Alexandria.
Mr. Dutilh was of Dutch birth and possessed
to the full the energetic qualities and the
Scrupulous honesty and sense of duty of his
race. After being for some time Consul Gener-
al of the Netherlands at Cairo, he dedicated
his life to numismatic studies, entered the
Ghizeh Museum, and was transferred to
Alexandria in 1896. Thanks to his efforts
the Alexandria Museum contains a first-class
collection of the Ptolemaic end Roman coinage
of Egypt, which ranks among the richest collec-
tions of the kind in the world. Mr. Dutilh
published an extraordinary number of brochures
on his favorite study, in all of which he dis-
placed a wide erudition and a remarkable
diligence, happily combined with a no less
admirable modesty, and was at all times ready
to give information as to the dates, histories
or values of coins submitted to him by en-
quirers. He was an honorary member of the
Egyptian Institute and corresponding member
of a number of European numismatic societies.
He was a contributor to the "Journal In-
ternational de de Numismatique,” published
by Svoronos of Athens, to the "Revue Beige
de Numismatique”, the "Revista numismatica
Italiana,” the “Bulletin de l'Institut Egyptien,"
and the "Bulletin de la Société Archaeologique
d'Alexandrie.” He was 69 years old at the
time of his death. His funeral takes place
this afternoon at 5 o’clock.

Mme DIMITRI BEY BISSARA.
We also regret to announce the death of
Mme. Dimitri Bey Bissara, who died yesterday
in her 65th year. The funeral of deceased will
take place at 5 p.m. to-day.

CHRONIQUE FINANCIERE
L’animation va croissant sur notre marché,
grâce à l’abondance du numéraire en Europe
et aux facilités que font les banques établies
récemment en Egypte, grâce aussi à la fermeté
du coton. A moins d'évènements imprévus, tout
fait dono prévoir que nous aurons une saison
d’été aussi bien remplie que l’an passé, quoique
plus surchargée.
le chiffre d’affaires a été considérable, sur-
tout en National Bank ancienne et nouvelle
émission, en Banque d'Athènes, en Hôtels et
en Daïra.
On donne comme raison de la sou-
daine de la National Bank le prochain lance-
ment de la Banque Nationale d'Abyssinie dont
l’émission serait confiée à la National et dont
on fixe la répartition sur la base de 1 action
Abyssine contre 6 actions National ; il ne faut
cependant accepter ces données qu’avec la plus
extrème réserve, attendu que les groupes
français et italien sont respectivement inté-
ressés pour on quart dans l'affaire. Tout ce
qu’on peut dire, c’est qu’il se présente déjà
des acheteurs de Banque d’Abyssinie à 1 £ de
prime ; mais il n’a pu être traité aucune affaire
dans l'incertitude où l’on est encore de la date
de l’émission et du nombre d'actions offertes
en souscription au public égyptien. Il nous
revient en dernière heure que la Banque d'A-
byssinie a été traitée à £ 8 de prime hors cor-
beills.
Influencé par cette prochaine émission, le
cours de la National Bank est monté graduel-
lement de 26 1/2. à 27 13/32, cours auquel
elle clôture.
La Nouvelle a exactement suivi les mêmes
fluctuations que l'Ancienne. Les spéculateurs
semblent même la préférer pour les raisons
déjà citées.
En Agricole on a fluctué durant tonte la
semaine entre 13 15/16 et 14 pour finir ven-
deurs à ce dernier prix. La Fondateur est de- 
mandée à 1035.
De 820 au débat les actions Crédit Foncier
fléchissent à 815 pour rebondir presque aussi-
tôt à 825 1/2. On clôture à 824. Il va suis dire
que le groupe du Foncier emploiera tous ses
efforts à pousser les cours plus haut pour pré-
parer un succès à la prochaine émission d'ac-
tions nouvelles à 810. Selon las informations
recues ces jours derniers, l'émission des obliga-
tions 3 1/2 pour cent a rencontré le meilleur
accueil à Paris et a été amplement couverte.
La Fondateur monte de 8050 à 8350. avec
tendance à la hausse.
Après avoir fléchi de 9 3/8 à 9 1/4, la Land
Bank remonte graduellement jusqu’à “9 7/16
acheteurs.
La Cassa di Sconto ouvre à 178, fléchit à
176 1/2, mai reprend vers la fin à 181 1/2. La
Nouvelle est à 170 1/2.
Les transactions en Banque d'Athènes ont
été considérables. De 128 1/2 le cours monte
à 132, prix auquel on détache coupon (4 frs.) ;
ceci ramène le cours à 128, mais la valeur con-
tinue sa marche ascendante et atteint 130 1/4
ex coupon, ce qui représente une avance de
près de 6 francs pour la semaine. La hausse
provient du vote en première lecture de la pro-
position Pesmazoglu par le parlement hellé-
