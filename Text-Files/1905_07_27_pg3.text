New York, July 26.
After a conference with Baron Komura, M.
Takahira visited President Roosevelt to-day at
Oyster Bay with reference to the Peace Con-
ference.	(Reuter.)
New York, July 26.
President Roosevelt will receive Baron Ko-
mura informally on Friday.	(Reuter.)
New York, July 25.
M. Sato, the spokesman of Baron Komura,
in an interview, said that he was confident that
peace will be successfully negotiated. - The
Japanese will be guided by moderation, and
will not make excessive demands. But as the
war is costing a million dollars a day, there is
a feeling that there ought to be an indemnity.
It is probable that the conclusion of an armis-
tice will be the first move of the negotiations.

LOCAL AND GENERAL.
CAB ACCIDENT. — A little girl was run over
by a cab near Bab Sidra yesterday and severe-
ly injured.
STRAY AND OWNERLESS DOGS found in the
Shoubra district of Cairo during the night of
Friday and at daybreak on Saturday will be
poisoned by the police.
RESULTS OF IMPRUDENCE.—Two Arabs of
Mex have been removed to hospital suffering
from bums received while they were filling a
bottle with methylated spirit near an uncovered
light
PICKPOCKET CAUGHT.—This morning, a fruit-
seller who plies his trade near the old Custom-
house caught a pickpocket in the act of seizing
his purse, overpowered him, and handed him
over to the police.
SUEZ CANAL.—10 vessels passed through
the Canal on the 24th inst., 8 of which were
British, 1 German, 1 Italian. The day's receipts
were frs. 298,496.91, making the total from
the 1st inst. frs. 6,810,002.75.
FIRE AT MANSOURAH.—We hear that a
serious fire broke out on the night of the
24-25th inst. at Mansourah, and completely
destroyed the property of Mme Vve Makeh.
It appears that the property is insured with the
Guardian Insurance Company. The damages
amount to about £550.
THE PLAGUE.—Yesterday's bulletin records
two fatal cases at Alexandria, the victims being
a native boy and a Sudanese potter, both of
whom were found dead in different houses at
Nagah. There were three recoveries at Alex-
andria. Three cases (one fatal) are reported
from Ashmoun.
SUPPRESSION OF SLAVERY.—The Service for
the Suppression of Slavery has asked the
Ministry of Justice for a special tribunal for
the trial of Hasbo Hammad El Bahri, one of
two Bedouins accused of having carried off
Bayoumi Farag, a Sudanese, and of having
sold him to some Hedjaz Bédouins.
KHEDIVE’S BIRTHDAY RECEPTION.—On Wed-
nesday, August 2 next, on the occasion of the
birthday of H. H. the Khedive, H. E. the
Regent will hold a reception at Ras-el-Tin

ALHAMBRE THEATRE.—We note that Les
Surprises de l’Heritage, the latest production
of M. George Ralli, is billed for performance
to-morrow evening. On Saturday next, a night

THE RESULTS OF HASHISH. — A native of
Mellawi recently brought some hashish paste
home in a tin, and after taking a dose, handed
the rest to his wife to keep. She tasted, and
tasted more, with the result that at 10 p.m.
she took a small roof lamp for a fire and began
to scream. Her husband, awakened from his
stupor by her cries, also saw a fire devouring
his house and roared for help. The neighbours,
hearing the noise, sent for a policeman, ima-
gining that murder was being committed, but
when they followed the shawish into the house
their alarm gave place to huge amusement at
the mistake made by the intoxicated pair.
BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.—We would
draw the attention of manufacturers and mer-
chants to the work of the British Chamber of
Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896
with the sole object of assisting British trade
in this country. The services of the Chamber
are always at the disposal of any member
desiring information on trade matters generally,
including the question of appointing suitable
agents. As no fee is charged for such advice,
it is obviously in the interests of all British
traders here to become members, especially
when it is remembered that the annual sub-
scription is merely the nominal one of £1. The
latter payment also includes a copy of the
monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home
enquirers can obtain further particulars from
our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which
acts as agents to the Chamber.

PERSONAL AND SOCIAL
During the absence on leave of Mansfield
Pasha, Moberly Bey will act as Commandant
of the Cairo Police.
Mr. Dunlop, Secretary General to the Min-
istry of Public lnstruction, is expected to
return from leave to-morrow.
Mr. J. Levi, Secretary General to the State
Statistical Bureau, has left Cairo for Port Said
and the Canal on business connected with the
collection of information and statistics.
Mr Dessalles d’Epinoix leaves Alexandria
to-day fox Italy by the Memphis.


THE YEMEN RISING-
JEWISH REFUGEES INTERVIEWED
(From our Correspondent.)
Suez, Wednesday.
The Jewish refugees who lately arrived at
Suez from Yemen, state that about 10,000
refugees are now at Adeu, of whom 2,000 are
Jews and 8,000 Moslems.
The rising in the Yemen, according to
their statements, is owing to the discontent
of the inhabitants, who prefer to be ruled by
Imam Yehia,—who has a claim to the throne
as a descendant of the old rulers,—rather than
by the Turkish Government Imam Yehia ,
appear! to be a good and very popular leader,
and is beloved throughout the Yemen.
The insurgents seem to have taken the upper
hand, and the rising has become general. San’a,
the capital of Yemen, was closely surround-
ed by the insurgents, and all communications
are cut. The Turkish troops defending the
town suffered considerably on account of
their being short of provisions, eta, before
the capture of the place.
Strange to say, the insurgents are very well
armed with rifles of the latest type, and have
got ample supplies of ammunition.
A Constantinople contemporary contains (at
last) some references to the Yemen rising. We
learn that "in consequence of some slight
disturbances in the Vilayet," Marshal Shakir
Pasha, with some battalions, attacked a village
occupied by the rebels, of whom hundreds
strewed the ground, while one Turkish soldier
alone fell wounded. The inhabitants of the
country implored the Sultan's clemency with
tears and prayers, asserting that they had
been driven to revolt by the threats of the
Imam's followers. They were pardoned by
Marshal Shakir Pasha, who, with Ahmed
Faizi Pasha, is on the march to San'a,
winning daily victories.
The non-Tarkuh Press seems to have taken
an alarmist view of the situation in Arabia, or
can it be that the exigencies of the censorship
demand the publication of military romances?

THE NILE FLOOD.
The rise of the Nile continues very slowly,
as the comparative table of the present and
last year's gauges shows, and it is probable
that the flood will not be appreciably felt in
Lower Egypt until towards the end of next
month. The result of this continued slow rise
is, as we announced in a recent issue, that it
has been found necessary to alter the rotations
to six days' working and twelve days' stoppage,
with the exception of lands where rice is
cultivated, in which cases five days' working
and only five days' stoppage are permitted.
Our Nile gauge table has been somewhat
incomplete for the last few days on account of
the irregularity with which some of the read-
ings are received at the Ministry of Public
Works. No reading of the Rosaires guage has
been received at the Ministry since the 21st
of this month, and it has been suggested that
this is due to a breakdown in the telegraphic
system. The readings of Assouan, upstream,
also have not been received since July 20
either by telegram or by letter, bat this reading
is not of great importance, and oar readers
will be able to gauge the condition of the
river at this point from the downstream
readings.

SHARAKI LANDS.
The prohibition of the watering of lands,
generally known in Egypt under the name of
“Sharaki,” as ordered by a Ministerial “Arrêté"
of the 10th of April, 1905, will cease to have
effect from July 28.

STATE RAILWAY BOARD.
We hear that the present Railway Board,
composed of Major L’Estrange Johnstone, M.
Barois, and Skander Pasha Fehmy, will be
dissolved by Khédivial decree in October, and
will be replaced by the new governing body,
over which H. E. Mustapha Pasha Fehmy
will preside.

DAIRA SANIEH FOUR PER CENT.
LOAN.
By Decree published on April 29 last, the
Egyptian Government has decided to repay, in
cash, the debt of the Daïra Sanieh. This
decision, taken in conformity with the special
dispositions of the Decrees of June and July,
1890, and November, 1904, promulgated with
the assent of the Powers, binds bondholders
of all nationalities. ln consequence, Coupon No.
30, falling due on October 15 next, will be the
last coupon paid by the controllers, and the
bonds in circulation must be presented for
repayment. All bonds, stamped, must be de-
posited, at latest, on October 1 next. It has
been decided to redeem the stamped bonds in
October, in cash, instead of an exchange against
new bonds.

NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
FIRE ON GERMAN COLLIER.
( From our Correspondent. )
Port Said, Wednesday.
During the past few days quite a number of
German colliers have passed through here on
their way back from China and Rodjestvensky’s
fleet—many of them with their original cargoes
still on board. Yesterday, the Macedonia, one
of the fleet of 21 which remained in Port Said
Six weeks on her way out, arrived from the
Canal to await orders, and at 8 p.m. a fire was
discovered in her main hold, amongst her
cargo of coal, which had been on board over
seven months. The fire is undoubtedly due to
spontaneous combustion, and this is not sur-
prising, considering the length of time the coal
has been under hatches. The Canal Company's
fire appliances were at once got ready in anti-
cipation of the necessity of flooding the ship,
and she was, at midnight, placed in the petro-
leum basin, out of the way of other ships, in
case she might become much worse. All hatches
have been Carefully closed and it is hoped that
the fire will smother itself out in a short time.

THE ST. KILDA STORY.
In your yesterday’s issue I notice a para-
graph to the effect that the members of the
St. Kilda's crew who were landed here from
the Dneiper express surprise and amassment at
the report that a display of force was made
here by British cruisers. The paragraph which
you reproduced from a Marseilles paper was
so supremely ridiculous that at the time I
did not think it worth while contradicting.
There was not the least difficulty about land-
ing the men here ; no official representations
were made by the captains of the British
men of-war, nor did they or the British Con-
sul present any ultimatum— in a neutral sea-
port ! and the two cruisers certainly did
not heave up anchors, as the Marseilles paper
states. The matter was all arranged by 3 p.m.
and the crew quietly landed, without the
least fuss, nor was any doubt expressed about
their landing here even by the men themsel-
ves, for they were told in the canal that they
would be liberated, though the captain might,
proceed to Libau.

THE NEW ABBAS MOSQUE
The Abbas Mosque, which was formally
opened by Sheikh Abdul Gomel on the 16th
inst., is a building of considerable beauty.
Standing in its own courtyard, rearing its
white and blue minaret far above its some-
what squalid surroundings, it, by mere com-
parison, at once attracts the eye. The outer
walls are painted red and yellow in horizontal
bars, its 24 windows are fitted with handsome
iron "grilles," and its three entrances re-
present the old style of Moorish architecture
in all its beauty. The interior, which is
scrupulously clean, is lit by electricity, and
the woodwork is highly polished, the prevail-
ing colours being brown and red with patches
of blue here and there. A spiral stairway leads
to a gallery at the west end of the building,
and its roof is supported by four rows of
pillars, which are also the support of 16 Moorish
arches, all of dazzling whiteness. The whole
appearance of the mosque is decidedly at-
tractive, and a visit amply repays the curious.

NEW HARBOUR WORKS.
Credits amounting to LE 443,200 have been
granted by the Ministry of Finance to the
Ports and Ligh’s Administration. We shall
publish to-morrow an account of the new works,
which will be of enormous benefit to the port.
The Regent, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield,
Mr. Mitchell Innés, Acting Financial Adviser,
and Mr. Higgins visited the St Lawrence
yesterday from the Teir el Mina, and inspected
the dredging operations in the new pass that
is being made into the harbour.

QUARANTINE.
A telegram from Constantinople states that
arrivals from Alexandria are now subjected to
48 hours’ quarantine, a medical examination,
and disinfection. This applies to departures
since the 24th inst. Arrivals from Adalia
undergo medical examination and disinfection.
Another telegram from Constantinople
states that the quarantine measures against
Bahrein have been replaced by 48 hours'
observation and disinfection.

STEAMER MOVEMENTS.
The S.S. Plymothian, of the Westcott and
Laurance Line, left Malta yesterday and is
due here Sunday next with general cargo from
Antwerp and London.
The Messageries Maritimes S.S. Niger

yesterday, the passengers being landed after
medical examination.

LEBANESE ACTUALITIES.
HABIB PASHA'S DISMISSAL.
(From a Correspondent).
The discharge of the Vice-President of the
Administrative Council, Habib Pasha El Saad,
is the topic of the day in Lebanese and
Beirutine circles. During the short period of
financial plenty preceding the ignominious fall
of his banking firm, Habib Pasha, by the free
use of gold and skilful insinuations, obtained
not only the title of Pasha and its accompany-
ing honors, but the support of high quarters
at Constantinople, and this, combined with the
fact of his belonging to one of the well-known
Maronite families of the Lebanon, was the
most potent factor in his election ; for France
bas been the patron nation of the Maronites
ever since Lebanon’s partial independence.
Habib Pasha, however, is a characteristic type
of the Oriental diplomatist with whom finesse
is the supreme end, and the cultivation and
exercise of which may, if necessary, be made
at the expense of principle. Habib Pasha pos-
sessed in a high degree this finesse ; indeed he
is “trop fin," as one of the Consuls once said.
As a matter of fact, having secured his object
from French patronage, he turned to court
English favor. But diplomacy in Lebanon is
as jealous as an Oriental maid, and dalliance
with consuls of different Powers finally ended
in the disgrace of the diplomatic flirt.
The career of Habib Pasha has not been a
brilliant one in the full sense of the term, as
indeed no career can be under the regime of
the present Mutessarif, whose dread of party
ascendancy has led him to the annihilation of
all parties, the result of which was the aliena-
tion of all sympathies. He stands now in cold
isolation resting on very unstable ground.
Solidarity is an inherent quality of civic life,
and will always determine the existence of
parties. It is the skilful control of this party
feeling and force that constitutes real states-
manship.
Some assert that Habib Pasha, with all
his unprincipled finesse, kept himself above
the general taint of bribery, while others
occupying high official positions, who have
been in sufficient proximity to see things
hidden from the general gaze, allege that if he
has not stooped to petty briberies he has
deftly committed wholesale ones in the monopo-
ly of the carriage tax, the carriage road
contracts, and in the widespread changes in the
mayoral posts. My personal knowledge of Habib
Pasha enables me to affirm that, whatever
failings he may have, he certainly cannot be
charged with being a man of petty aims, and
the facts I am giving are simply the re flection
of the public mind, which unfortunately for our
Pasha is not very kindly disposed towards him.
The mayors or sheikhs of villages in the
Lebanon are supposed to be the representatives
of the people, and although they are elected
on the high principle of universal suffrage, yet
in their election the intrigues of priestly and
consular parties enter so largely that these
sheikhs no more represent public opinion than
would the chosen creatures of priestly or con-
sular patronage. And then the passion for
politics has been fostered so much in the heart
of the Lebanese, and consular favor has come
to be regarded by him so much an end of
existence, that the best-intentioned amongst
them ends by sacrificing the public good for
such petty ends. The mayoral posts have,
therefore, come to be important factors in the
ballots for high appointments, and for all the
miserable ammout of the salary, they have
come to be objects of important bribes. One
handled sterling is no uncommon bribe for the
obtaining of the post of Sheikh Sulh.
Now, whether a dim knowledge of these
alleged disloyalties has been the determining
factor of dismissal or not, it is certain that the
Mutessarif has for some time back been keep-
ing Habib Pasha in office under the com-
pulsion of higher influences. Lately, however,
on perceiving that the powerful support
of the French Consulate was withdrawn
owing to the Vice-President's assiduous atten-
tions to another Consulate, the chief
saw his opportunity and dealt the long con-
templated blow. It is said that the Mowing
was the apparent occasion for dismissal.
Colonel Barbar Bey, who, by the way, is
brother-in-law of Habib Pasha, had presented
to the Administrative Council a petition to
invite tenders for the supply of uniforms for
the soldiery. The 17th of July was fixed for
the reception of the different tenders and the
decision as to the most suitable. In the mean-
time, Barbar Bey, in secret accord, it is said,
with his brother-in-law, had concluded the
contract with a certain Mr. Abela, a British
subject of Maltese origin, and in soliciting the
official sanction of the Council he urged that,
as the supply was of an exceptionally argent
nature and the tender seemed to him an ad-
vantageous one, he deemed it advisable to
close it. The members of the Council are said
to have been prepared by the astute Vice-
President, and to their decision the unsuspect-
ing Mutessarif fixed his seal.
A few days later the other contractors who
had been left in the lurch raised, as may be
imagined, a scandal which did not fail to reach
the ears of the Governor-General, who there-
upon wrote a letter to Habib Pasha calling
upon him to cause the Council to retract its
decision, failing which he would hold him
personally responsible for the consequences. It
may be parenthetically observed that the
Administrative Council has, ever since the
premature fading of the first glow of Musaffer
pasha's prestige, made a point of opposing any
scheme that they knew he had at heart, and
Habib Pasha, with his diplomatic talent, was
the fittest person to act as the intermediary
and conciliating medium between the Governor
and the recalcitrant Council, and some allege
that he not unfrequently used to secretly set
the latter against their President in order to
strengthen his hold on his chief. In this con-
nection one cannot help passing a remark on
the injudiciousness of the law that provides
for the retention in office of the members of
the Administrative Council of Lebanon for a
period of six years, and the non liability to
dismissal except for a criminal or judicial
offence.
Now Habib Pasha made a dry reply to
the Governor’s covert threat, saying, with a
show of truth and reason, that the decision
he was asking him to subvert had been
duly signed and sealed by the Governor him-
self. Thereupon Muraffer Pasha wrote the Vice-
President a personal letter couched in very
courteous terms, which some qualified even as
undignified, in which he said that be regretted
he felt compelled to inform Habib Pasha that
his services were no more required. It is said
that the officer who had been charged with the
conveyance of the missive, meeting Habib
Pasha at Alay, told him that his chief had
written him a personal letter which had been
sent to his Beyrout address in the hope that
it would reach him more quickly. Muraffer
Pasha had just happened to arrive at Aley to
call on the British Consul-General, and Habib
Pasha hied to meet his chief. “I have been told,"
he said, “that your Excellency has written
me a letter which has been sent to Beyrout.
May I ask what the purport of it is" "You
shall know when yon read it," was the dry
reply. Habib Pasha then repaired to the British
Consulate to learn there the news of his
dismissal.
It is believed that the Kaimakam of Metn,
Emir Youssef Ismail Bellama, is to succeed to
the Vice-Presidency, although I myself consider
this appointment open to doubt, as the Emir
Youssef prefers to keep the Kaimakamat owing
to its being a more lucrative and a less res-
ponsible and troublesome post than the Vice-
Presidency, for which his rather delicate health
partly incapacitates him. Should the Kaima-
kamat of Metn become vacant it will be filled
presumably by Sheikh Rachid E1 Khasen, the
oft-dismissed Kaimakam of cosmic tame.
Small fortunes will be made through these
appointments, and meantime this unhappy
province, that fades under the fatal shadow of
the wings of the seven Powers, is bleeding to
death, or at least to anaemic exhaustion,to fatten
the lightly chosen rulers of its destiny.

Minnie and Coot each have 9 points for the
monthly prize, so have tied and will race a
special race to decide the winner. In Class II.
the Derphil carries off the prize, having 10
points against the Jessica’s S. Unfortunately
the Jessica loses her points for July 12, when
the Celtic ran into her and pat her “hors da

Next week there will be a special single race
for the cups (one for each class) kindly given
