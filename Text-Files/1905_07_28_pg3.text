CAUSES OF THE WAR.
M. WITTE'S OPINION.
London, July 27.
Reuter's Agency learns from St Petersburg
that M. Witte, in an interview which has been
published, is reported to have declared that
the institution of the Vice-royalty in the Far
East was one of the principal causes of the war,
for it was a provocation to China, Japan,
Great Britain, and the United States, and
corresponded neither to the real strength nor
the true interest of Russia in the Far East,
and particularly in the Pacific Ocean, where,
properly speaking, she has no interests. (R.)

action, which will please all but the arbagis,
and none more than the wives and daughters
of Europeans and Syrians, who, being unable
to afford carriages, were often exposed to the
insulting remarks and gestures of Moslems of
the lower classes, many of whom would be
furious if a non-Moslem merely spoke to their
wives and daughters, but see no reason why
they should not pester or insult unveiled
women to their heart’s content
CHURCH OF SCOTLAND SCHOOLS.—The closing
exhibition of the boys’ school took place on
Wednesday at 4 p.m. at the High School in the
Missala quarter. A large marquee was erected
behind the school for the accommodation of
the parents and friends of the pupils, and its
capacity was fully taxed. A varied programme
was submitted, and was greatly enjoyed by the
audience. A most exemplary programme it
was, as each piece was both short and under-
stood by the pupils ; it was evident they
were not merely repeating by heart, but
that pains had bean taken to make the children
understand the meaning of what they were
saying. It is needless almost to add that the
pupils acquitted themselves with great distinc-
tion, and their appearance and their work
reflect the greatest credit upon Mr. Buchanan
had his staff, a credit that is all the greater
as we are given to understand that, owing to
circumstances beyond the control of the ma-
nagement, the school has been understaffed for
some time. We hear that this defect will be
remedied in October, when the school re-opens;
MrT William Thom having been appointed to
the place of Mr. James Gordon, who was
transferred to Beyrout After the programme
had been submitted, a table literally groaning
with prizes was lifted to the platform, and
these were kindly presented to the boys by
Mrs. H.P. Reid. The dux of the school was L.
Rosenberg, who, in addition to five book
prizes, carried off: the silver medal given by
Major Allan,of Glasgow, for Scripture knowledge.
The medallist for painting was George Potins,
and the other Scripture medallist was L.
Loulloup. The other chief prizetakers were
Frances Burigans, Giacomo Benveniste, and
Rinaldo Benveniste. The whole proceedings
were carried through in less than two hours,
and the management are to be heartily con-
gratulated upon it At the close Mr. Buchanan
invited the audience to pass into one of the
rooms in the school to inspect the work of the
pupils, and from this one could understand
what an infinite amount of pains and care are
taken in the education of the children.

NEW HARBOUR WORKS.
DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The new pass into the harbour, which is now
being dredged to a depth of 37 feet by the
St Lawrence, will be 600 feet in breadth, and
something over half a mile in length. It will
pass quite close to the wreck of the Cairo and
bears on the light near Mex at an angle of
61°E.
It is hoped that the new pass will be ready
for steamer traffic in two years’ time ; about
1,000 feet by 200 have been dredged so
far, and the sand and silt brought up are being
dropped to the south of the breakwater. The
reason for this is the necessity of facilitating
the prolongation of the breakwater, Which will
be carried on for some 800 yards to within a
short distance of the red gas buoy.
A new breakwater is to be earned out from
the abattoir mole which is now under con-
struction. This mole will form a harbour
where vessels of deep draught carrying cattle
can accost at the side of the quay, and the
cattle can be driven over gangways straight to
the abattoir, while the profungating of the
mole for some 200 yards will screen the port
from N.-westerly gales much more effectually
than has hitherto been possible.
Altogether about L.R. 120,000 is to be spent
on the new moles and nearly £100,000 on
dredging in the near future, but these sums do
not exhaust the list of credits voted for har-
bour improvements. Beyond the abattoir six
now timber quays are to be commenced in the
quarantine anehotegh, and a line Of railway
carried from'thèsé quays to Gabbari. The old
port of Omsk Kabebe is to be levelled, the
shallows between the site of the proposed
quays and the shore reclaimed, and more
quays will probably be taken in hand after the
completion of the first six.
The coal quay is to be widened, and the
present “bottle neck,” where half a dozen
lines of rails cross in bewildering confusion,
will be at least trebled in breadth by reclama-
tion on the S.W. ride of the quay. Five new
quay berths are also to be constructed on the
same side of the coal quay beyond the "bottle
neck.”
Finally, Quay “K” is to be prolonged and
widened, so as to close the southern entrance
into the careening basin, the isolated mole
opposite being in part joined to it and in
part removed, so as to allow vessels entering
the Arsenal basin to enter the careening basin
with the minimum of difficulty. To effect this
the N.E. end of this isolated mole, which
commences opposite the Khediviad Mail S.S.
Company’s berth, is to be done away with.
About £8,000 is to be spent on this and on
the widening of Quay “K,” while about
£180,000 has been allowed for the construc-
tion of the six timber quays off the quarantine
anchorage.

REGIMENTAL SPORTS.
A very enjoyable afternoon was spent
yesterday at Mustapha barracks, when the
2nd Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment held
their annual athletic sports on the anniversary
of the battle of Maiwand, where the regiment
displayed such conspicuous bravery. The events
were varied and amusing, and the proceedings
were only finished at 6.45 p.m., when Mrs.
Cave gave away the prizes.
Amongst those present we noticed Mr. and
Mrs. Mansfield de C. Findlay, Admiral and
Lady Blomfield, Mr. and Mrs. McPherson-Grant,
Mr. Mitchell Innes, Mr. Higgins, Mr. Haytor,
Mrs. Gordon, Mrs. Cave, Mrs. Finch, Mrs.
Harvey, Mrs. Moore, Mrs. Crawley, Miss
Massey, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Carver, Mr. and
Mrs. Kelham.
We hear this battalion leaves for Khartoum
and Cairo early in October and will probably be
replaced by the 2nd Battalion Dublin Fusiliers,
at present stationed at Buttevant

SAN STEFANO CASINO.
Another success was scored at the Casino
yesterday with the second vocal concert of the
season. The programme gave ample scope for
the display of the artistes’ talents. The duet
from Cavalleria Rusticana sung by Sig.
Giovanelli and Signa. Cantoni was exceedingly
well rendered and had to be repeated. We
may remind our readers of the Verdi Festival
to be given on Sunday morning. The programme
includes the well-known trio from Lombardi,
preceded by the famous violin solo.
The following is the menu of the dinner to

ROBBERY ON THE ASSOUAN.
ONE THOUSAND POUNDS STOLEN.
The Khedivial S.S. Assouan, which left
Beyrout on Tuesday, has been the scene of a
daring and ingenious theft. After leaving Jaffa
on Wednesday evening, the steward discovered
that the strong-room of the vessel had been
forced and that £1,000 in gold and specie had
disappeared. It was remarked afterwards
that a first-class passenger, believed to be a
European, who had embarked at Beyrout and
booked a passage for Egypt, had disappeared
at Port Said, where he went ashore with many
other passengers, leaving behind all, or almost
all, his personal effects.
As soon as the theft was discovered careful
inquires were made on board and the captain
communicated with the Egyptian police autho-
rities.
When the Assouan arrived in harbour
this morning, she was boarded by Mr. Freeman,
H.B.M.’s Vice-Consul, and the secret police.
We are assured that the steward of the
Assouan, on being shown a photograph by the
police, recognised the missing first class pas-
senger, in spite of the fact that the suspect,
While on board, wore bandages which partly
concealed his face, as,if he had sustained some
disfiguring injury.
The police confidently expect to be able to
lay hands on the supposed thief within a very
short time.

AKHMIN NOTES.
(From our Correspondent.)
Akhmim, July 96.
Thé omdeh of El Awama reported to the
Markas authorities here yesterday that a
murder had taken place in his village. The
mamour el markaz, Mohamed Effendi Fehmy,
went to the spot and learned that the sheikh
of the ghaffirs met a fellah who had just stolen
a sheep and questioned him as to how he came
by the animal. The father of the thief then
same up and threatened to shoot the sheikh it
he did not leave his son alone and then, in
spite of the entreaties of a bystander, fired
point blank at the unfortunate man and killed
him. The culprit has been arrested.
Abdallah Bey Wahby who replaced Hussein
Bey Wassif of the Irrigation Department,
during that official’s absence, inspected the
work done by the Markaz engineer, Mohamed
Effendi Khalid, to-day and expressed his
approval thereof.

OBITUARY
MRS. H. MACLOUGHLIN.
It is with the greatest regret that we learn
of the death of Mrs. H. MacLoughlin, wife of
the acting manager of the Cairo branch of the
Imperial Ottoman Bank, which has occurred
at Castlebar, County Mayo, Ireland. Mr. and
Mrs. MacLoughlin were only married in
September last. After spending the winter
with her husband in Cairo Mrs. MacLoughlin
went to Castlebar to spend the summer
there, and about a fortnight ago gave birth
to a daughter. The many friends of Mr.
MacLoughlin will sympathise most deeply
with him in his sad loss, and we offer to him
our most sincere condolences.

A DANGER TO EGYPT
ENGLAND, GERMANY AND TURKEY
IN THE NEAR EAST.
BY WILHELM MEISTER.
Translated
II.-(Continued from July 25).
We must now take note of the forces that
are capable of preventing the fulfilment of
such a scheme. Dangerous yesterday and
irresistible to-morrow, whether considered in-
dividually and collectively, for the moment they
constitute the mere unsubstantial shadow of
an obstacle and may almost be said to favor
decisive action on the part of Great Britain.
These forces are five in number, bach of which
represents a European Power, and first and
foremost we must consider Turkey, as the
Power most interested. Then come Germany,
Russia, France, and Italy. At the present mo-
meant the two last-named elements would greet
either of the solutions— Occupation or Neutral-
isation—with satisfaction. The remaining
powers could effect nothing by their own re-
sources, as I propose to demonstrate.
First let us take Turkey and consider what
resistance she could offer to the amputation of
Syria from her political organism. In the pre-
sent incomplete condition of the Syrian railway
system, not yet linked with Diarbekir and the
great central trunk line, the idea of an offensive
movement against Egypt is chimerical, and the
Turks, in case of war, would be hard put to it
to make head against the Christian popula-
tion of the mountains, openly revolting
and found in arms and munitions of war
by the masters of the seas.
The sea-routes,till now used by the Ottoman
Government in the suppression of all revolu-
tionary or separatist movements in the distant
provinces of the Empire, by which it is now
dispatching soldiers to the Yemen, and which
enabled it six years ago to transport forces
against the Druses of the Hauran, would be
closed in case of war with a naval Power, and
it is difficult to see how the communications
between Syria and Asia Minor could be main-
tained in default of roads and railways, or
practicable passes through the formidable
carrier of the Taurus and its Eastern gorges.
Assuming that the present garrison of Syria
composed of the forces quartered in the districts
of Damascus and Aleppo would suffice if aided
by a corps of Redifs raised in the province, for
in offensive movement to the south, how could
the provisioning and the supply of these forces
be assured? The Ottoman soldier can exist
on the scantiest nations, but his rifles require
as many cartridges, and his field guns as many
shells, as those of other nations. An officer of
the Turkish General Staff stationed at Da-
mascus informed the writer, whom he met at
Djevad	Pashe’s house and with whom he
became intimate, this in spite of all efforts the
military reforms could not be properly applied
in Syria till their first article had been carried
out, and the first article and condition of the
reform scheme is the construction of a complete
railway system in Syria, Mesopotamia, and
Asia Minor. For the moment the Syrian Corps
d’Armée, in spite of the ability of their com-
manding officer, are armies in the rough, and
brave and soldierly as is the human material
of these forces, they lack, and must lack, till
the military reforms are finally carried out, the
immense extrinsic value conferred by modern
armament and organisation
This being the case it is hard to see how the
above mentioned forces, the Nizam of Aleppo
and Damascus and the Redifs of Syria, could 
undertake an offensive campaign against Egypt,
before the completion of the strategic railways
and advance through desolate or mountainous
regions while their communications were
harassed by the Christians and Druses of the 
Lebanon and the Hauran, and their rear was 
threatened by the menace of a disembarkation 
of an expedition dispatched after the begin-
ning of the war from England or Idia. The
offensive being therefore a physical impos-
suability, we have to consider what rule these 
forces could play on the defensive. Anyone
who knows the coast strip that formed the
Phoenicia of the ancients, its people and their
history, will be ready enough to admit that 
from the opening of hostilities, that is, at the
first gleam bringing a hope, however distant,
of freedom from a detested yoke, these people,
whose narrow and rugged home borders the 
sea for its whole length, would instantly im-
provide forces and take the field against the 
Turks under British officers. The mountainous 
ridge of the Lebanon would be fortified on both
tis flanks, on the west or maritime side, to aid
the warships to prevent any movement of the 
enemy along the coast road, and on the eastern 
side, which commands the depression of the
B’aka or Coele-Syria, to aid the guerrillas of the 
hills to check any movement along the plain
below them. The defending forces stationed 
on the coast between Tripoli and Tyre would 
be condemned to inaction — or extermination.
Those echeloned in the Coelesyrian depres-
sion would be exposed to constant guerilla
attacks and virtually isolated from their base.
These fractions, representing a good third of 
the central forces, and the central force itself,
its effective strength reduced, deprived of
ammunitions and of a proper transport service,
would have no other alternative but to cling
to their cantonments and waste away there
or to dash themselves in reckless assaults
upon the artillery that would guard the passes
of the unsurveyed and dangerous mountain
barrier, in whose dangerous clefts and am-
bushes many an army has been swallowed up.

BRITISH AND FOREIGN STEEL
GIRDERS IN EGYPT.
To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
Dear Sir - Some years ago the Krupp firm
had a contract with the Egyptian Government
at a little over half the coat of supplying the
same quality of rails to their own government.
In Germany rails were delivered by Krupp’s
factory to the german Government at about
$9 per ton, the government paying all trans-
port charges. The same firm supplied the 
Egyptian Government with rails at about $5 a 
ton, franco to Gabbari, paying every penny for 
freights, transport, unloading, etc. Surely this
startling difference in the prices is entirely
due to the imposition of a protective tariff, as
the Krupp firm has nothing to fear in Ger-
many from foreign competition in Egypt or
elsewhere at excessively low prices.

A BATHING NUISANCE.
To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
Dear Editor,- I should like to bring the
following to your notice. I live at Halte 1,
Ramleh, ad have hired a bathing box for the
season down at a small bay near a Coastguard
station immediately behind this station. I
had the intention of bathing there most after-
noons but unfortunately I am hindered from
so doing by the following most revolting
circumstances. Every afternoon about ten
Arab families congregate there and bathe, the
children naked, the mothers can boast of some
little clothing which is hardly a shade better
than nothing, they leave their clothes and
babies lying over the beach where space is
very limited, and they are very unclean in
their habits, consequently the beach is pervaded
by most unpleasant odours.
A low class of Europeans also frequent this
same small bay ; they undress promiscuously on
the beach, on the rocks and behind the bathing
boxes. Is this right? Should not the owners of
the bathing boxes be considered, who pay rent
or hire for the erection of the
You will understand how limited space is
when I tell you that there is only room for
six boxes, including my own. These people,
besides crowding us out, make use of our
boxes to undress themselves behind them and
to screen their uncleanness. What is Egypt 
doing to allow this filthy state of affairs? I hear
complaints from many that the coast from 
Ibrahimieh to San Stefano and beyond is
made unbearable for the respectable European
residents. No decent woman can at any time
of the afternoon walk along the shore without
being insulted and seeing indecent sights.
Egypt is no doubt improving for the Egyptians,
but the Egyptians are not improving it.
Among the many things that lord Cromer is
having taught to the Egyptians might it not
be advisable to include decency !!!
