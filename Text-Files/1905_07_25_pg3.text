THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE, TUESDAY, JULY 26, 1905.
TSAR AND KAISER.
THE MONARCHS’ INTERVIEW.
CONJECTURES AS TO OBJECT
St. Petersburg, July 24.
The Tsar was accompanied by his brother
only ; neither the Court nor the Ministry of 
- Foreign Affairs being represented. The fact is
perhaps to be explained by consideration for
French feeling. There will be a second meeting
on board the Standart to-day, and the Tsar
will return to Peterhoff in the evening.
It is authoritatively stated that the meeting
took place at the request of the Emperor
William, who informed the Tsar, from Sweden,
that he was desirous of seeing him, in order to
convince him of the sincerity of the German
policy towards Russia.
Probably he was anxious to counteract the
effect produced by the cordial reception of
Prince Arisugawa in Germany and the German
participation in the Japanese loan. The real
significance of the meeting, however, can only
be surmised. M. Witte knew nothing of it
before his departure.
It is pointed out in official circles that the
exchange of views between the Emperors is
calculated to assist the labours of the Russian
plenipotentiaries, by promoting a general
entente on the affairs of the Far East (R.)
Berlin, July 24.
The German papers suggest that the inter-
view emanated from the Tsar. The motives
and objects of the meeting are being anxiously
discussed throughout Europe, especially in
France, where M. Witte is at present discuss-
ing future policies, notably the possibility of a
loan.
The Emperors' yachts only met at 10 o'clock
last night but visits	were immediately ex-
changed. The Monarchs separated at 1.30
this morning	(Reuter.)
Borgo, July 24.
After having exchanged repasts on board
the Hohenzollern and the Polar Star, the Tsar

GOVERNMENT CRISIS.
MR. BALFOUR’S ATTITUDE.
OPPOSITION PROTESTS.

London, July 24.
House of Commons.—Mr. Balfour has an-
nounced that the Government will not resign,
In the House of Commons Sir Henry Camp-
bell-Bannerman condemned Mr. Balfour’s atti-
tude as utterly unconstitutional. Mr. Redmond
said that the Liberals and Irish will unite to
make the position unendurable by contesting
everything. Mr. Winston Churchill accused
the Government of (touting the traditions of
Parliament, and dishonoring the service of
the Crown.
There were several heated scenes and
speeches, but the Opposition, for tactical
reasons, deciding to abstain from a division,
the debate unexpectedly terminated.
The Government motion for adjournment
was carried without division, amid derisive
Government laughter and cheers.
The Government supporters had been most
effectively whipped, and the Opposition was
anxious to avoid any heavily unfavorable
divisions, which would counteract the effect of
Thursday’s defeat.
House of Lords.—Lord Lansdowne an-
nounced the decision of the Government.
Lord Rosebery said that Mr. Balfour is strain-
ing the principles of the Constitution to their
very foundation.	(Reuter.)
London, July 21.
The papers are full of surmises and conjes-
tures as to the date of dissolution, but nothing
is certain, and there are no further develop-
ments of the crisis.
The Liberal papers vehemently protest,
against the argument that foreign politics
make the resignation of the Government un-
advisable.	(Reuter.)

Hellenic Colony of Cairo were present at the
impressive ceremony over which Mgr. Photius,
the Greek Orthodox Patriarch, presided.
A RARE KORAN.—“Al Mokattam" states that
Mansfield Pasha, Commandant of the Cairo
Police, is taking a copy of the Koran with him
to England. This copy has a most curious
history, having been made by the secretary
of the false Khalifa, Abdallah el Tasishi, who
presented it to Emir Ahmed Wad Medani.
Manfield Pasha will present the copy to the
library of Beaumont College, where his son is

PROPOSED PROMENADE PIER.
EAST HARBOUR PIER SCHEME.
We have previously made reference to this
scheme, and are now able to give our readers
further information upon the subject. We
understand that the promoters made their
application to tho Alexandria Municipality in
December, 1903, for the necessary concession,
and by November, 1904, the final plans had
been submitted. All points of discussion had
been amicably settled between the Municipality
and the promoters about three months ago ;
and one would have therefore naturally con-
cluded that the issue of the concession would
have been only a question of a few days. But
alas we understand the whole question has
been shelved pro tem, as most of the Municipal- 
ity officials are away on leave and the matter
cannot be decided in their absence.
If it were only the members of the Municipal-
ity who would be affected we should have
nothing more to say in the matter; but such
is not the case: the whole population of Alex-
andria and its neighbourhood is interested
in this scheme, inasmuch as when the pier is
built it will fill a much-felt want and will be
the happy means to help them to pleasantly
while away the long Bummer evenings, away
from the noise and heat of the busy city, yet
so to speak within easy distance of their very
doors.
The length of the pier, we are given to
understand, will be over 1,000 feet, and in
appearance will resemble the very handsome
one erected at Brighton. The skeleton work
will be all of iron and supported on cast-iron
columns, while the decking will be of wood,
and several ornamental structures will be
erected upon it, such as a very handsome
pavilion, refreshment rooms, shops, and other
necessary accommodation suitable to the
country. There will also be the usual band-
stand and promenade, and first-class swimming
baths.
Not only will a pier of this kind supply a
much-felt want, but it will add considerably
towards embellishing the appearance and ge-
neral effect of the new quay wall and eastern
harbour. We therefore hope that the Municipa-
lity will do their utmost in getting through
with the necessary formalities as soon as pos-
sible, and place the promoters in a position to
start the work with as little delay as possible,
for the sooner this is done the sooner will the
pie be built and placed at the disposal of the
general public. As the cost of the proposed
pier will be very considerable, we think the
authorities should in the interest of the general
public give the promoters every assistance to
enable them to guarantee the enterprise prov-
ing a success, whilst at the same time safe-
guarding other public interests.
When completed, the new quay will un-
doubtedly be the fashionable promenade of
Alexandria, and we think the authorities would
be well advised to take every precaution to
avoid the collection of unlicensed touts and
loafers.

ALEXANDRIA’S DRAINAGE.
Considerable, if unwilling, attention has been
paid by the public to the unpleasant smells
arising from the drains daring the last two or
three weeks. The present season is the most
favorable for the outbreak of epidemics, and
we should like to point out to the Municipal
authorities that the least negligence may lead
to sanitary complications, the prevention of
which will be more easy than the pure. The
public would be glad to know whether the
linking of the subsidiary drains with the main
drain of the city has been completed or not,
and we are of opinion that the Municipality
would do well to reassure us on these points.
If the drainage system is not properly at
work yet we hope that the necessary measures
of disjunction and clearing of the drains not
yet linked with the main collector are being
taken with a view to minimise the evil results
of the non completion of the system.

ENTERTAINMENT AT SUEZ.
Last Saturday evening a most enjoyable
entertainment was given at the Cercle Inter-
national at Port Tewfik by Mr. O. D. Harris,
who produced an original play in one act
entitled “Pierrot et Pierrette," a pretty little
sketch in which Mr. Heale made an admirable
Pierrot and Miss Glennie a most charming
Pierrette, At the conclusion both actors and
author were called before the curtain and
greeted with much applause. Mr. Harris may
be remembered as the author of “The Mummy
and the Munmmer," a topical farce performed
at Suez last year.
The remainder of the programme consisted
of several well-selected items, among which
mention should be made of Mile'. Deperais's
singing of Raynals' “Valse Chantee,” end
Mrs. Hugues’ excellent tendering ol Tosti’s
“Chanson de Fortuno.” Both ladies received
enthusiastic encores. Mr. Dogmore scored a
“hit" in his amusing song, “The Stammering
Sweethearts.” Mr. Rittuck showed himself an
able banjoist in the solo “Bonnie Scotland."
‘Ailsa Mine," song by Mr. Heale, was very
much appreciated, as it fully deserved to be.
Instrumental selections were rendered by an
orchestra consisting of banjos (Messrs. G. W.
Hancock and E. J. Pittuck), violin (Mr. H. F.
Healy), and piano (Mr. H. T. Healy) The
entertainment concluded with a very amusing
and original “torn" by Mr. O. D. Harris, "In
the Twilight," with imitation violoncello obbli-
gato, which was continually interrupted by
rounds of applause. His ventriloquial sketch,
in which he introduced to the audience his
two figures "Joey” and "Eliza," caused great
amusement. Great credit is due to Mr. O. D.
Harris for his unflagging energy in arranging
the entertainment, and he is to be congratu-
lated on being able to secure the services of so
many talented amateur.


EGYPT AND MONTENEGRO.
COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT
CONCLUDED.
Yesterday's "Official Journal” contains cor-
respondence relating to the conclusion of a
commercial agreement between Egypt and
Montenegro. In a letter dated March 30,1905,
M. V. G. Voucovitch, Montenegrin Minister
for Foreign Affairs, informs the Egyptian Mi-
nister for Foreign Affairs that the Montenegrin
Government is anxious to give the necessary
stability to the commercial transactions be-
tween the two countries by the conclusion of
a treaty of commerce and navigation. While
the terms of such a treaty were being studied
the Egyptian Government would perhaps agree
with the Montenegrin in considering that a
provisional arrangement on the basis of the
most-favoured nation clause would be of great
advantage to both countries.
In a letter dated May 3, 1905, H. E.
Mostasha Pasha Fehmy suggests that the object
of both governments would be best obtained
not by the conclusion of a treaty, but by an
agreement finder which each country in their
mutual commerce is to enjoy the same privi-
leges as those possessed by nations which have
concluded commercial treaties with Egypt.This
provisional arrangement is to remain in vigour
until denounced by one or other of the contrac-
ting parties, who are bound to give 12 months’
notice of their intention.
The remainder of the correspondence is
confined to the formal acceptance by both
Governments of the proposal.

THE COTTON WORM.
The weekly official report issued by the
Ministry of the Interior on the work which is
being done for the destruction of the cotton
worm shows for the week ending 22nd inst.
not only a general and distinct decrease in the
number of areas which have been attacked,but
also that the cotton cultivations of three
provinces, namely, Fayoum, Minieh, and Beni-
Souef, which had suffered previously, have
during the last week remained entirely free of
the worm, During the preceding week 27,026
feddans were in all attacked in these provinces,
so that the non-appearance of the worm through-
out last week may be taken as an indication
that these provinces have been entirely cleared
of it, and its re-appearance is regarded as im-
probable.
Tho reports from other provinces are as
follows:-
Ghizeh :—880 feddans, belonging to 379 pro-
prietors, have been attacked by the worm and
have all been cleared from it
Kalioubieh :—318. feddans, belonging to 174
proprietors, have been attacked, and 407
feddans here been cleared by 2,608 children,
Menoufieh : -1,106 feddans, belonging to
492 proprietors, have been attacked and 1,335
feddans have been cleared by 7,260 children.
Gharbieh :—1,968 feddans, belonging to
254 proprietors, have been attacked and 1,898
feddans have been cleared by 3,665 children.
Sharkieh :—122 feddans, belonging to 55
proprietors, have been attacked and have all
been cleared by 520 children.
Behara :-31,035 feddans, belonging to 1,743
proprietors, have been attacked and 26,005
feddans have been cleared by 73,555 children.
Pakahlieh :—4,336 feddans, belonging to
1,015 proprietors, have been attacked and
3,995 feddans have been cleared by 15,174
children.
Damietts :-159 feddans, belonging to 72
proprietors, have been attacked and have all
been cleared by 1,025 children.

NEDWET EL ASSAL
The Nedwet el Assal has appeared in various
cotton cultivations but active steps are being
taken for its destruction.
Many of oar readers will doubtless re
member that in a note which was published by
the Ministry of the Interior the Nedwet el
Assal was described as a certain sooty fungus
which are attracted by a sticky kind of honey-
dew deposited on the cotton leaves by small
green midges, known as Aphis, which attack
the cotton plant at this time of year. It will be
useful to recall the method by which the
Aphis may be killed.
The plants are sprayed with a very fine
spraying machine, with an emulsion made of
1/2 rotl soap, 1 gallon water, 2 gallons kerosene,
and to this is added 25 times the bulk of
water. The 1/2 rotl soap is cut up and boiled in
the one gallon of water, until completely
dissolved, it is then taken off the fire, the two
gallons of kerosene are added, the whole is
vigorously stirred, and upon the addition of 25
times the built of water it is ready for spraying
on the leaves of the plant. Special attention
should be paid to the under surface of the
leaves, which is usually attacked by the insect.
It is important to note that the Aphis usually
appears on the borders of the cotton fields
near drains and water courses, and also that
spraying should be done early in the morning
or in the evening.

A DANGER TO EGYPT.
GERMANY AND TURKEY VERSUS
ENGLAND IN THE NEAR EAST.
BY WILHELM MEISTER.
(Translated).
II.—THE REMEDY.	
A glance at a map of the Near Bast and the
plan of the Turko-German General Staff
suggests the remedy. Since Egypt most be
defended at all costs, and since armed resist-
ance in Egypt will not avail, when the Turkish
preparations are complete, the only effective
guard against the blow is to check the mobili-
sation scheme that aims at using Syria as a
bridge between Egypt and Asia Minor. I
have pointed out in my first article that the
Anatolian grand trunk line that is now in
course of construction bifurcates at the longi-
tude of Diarbekir. Its western branch will link
with the Syrian system at Biredjik, on the
Euphrates, passing through Siverek and Orfa,
while the Eastern branch will be carried
through the plains of Mesopotamia and the
Tigris-Nahrwan valley towards Mosul, Bagdad,
Bassorah, and Koweit.
The Syrian branch, in itself a grand trunk
line, will run from north to south, throwing
out branches towards the Mediterranean
destined to carry the troops from each of the
segments into which they divide the country
to the main line, as the tributaries of a river
basin carry their waters to the main stream.
These branches link or will link the grand
trunk line with the ports of Alexandretta,
Latakia, Tripoli, Beyrout, Haifa, Jaffa, and
Gaza to the very frontiers of Egypt. Between
Sunamein and the Jordan about 120 miles
S. of Damasous a cross country line of about
100 kilometres in length will be pushed to
Jerusalem, thence to Hebron (ElKhalil), which
will be itself linked with Gaza.
All along the course of the line and its
branches garrisons are distributed, whose
strength varies according to the strategical
importance of the localities and which all
gravitate around the military centres of the
two commands into which the Army Corps
District of Syria is divided, the commands of
Aleppo and Damascus.
Covered and bound by these links of steel
Syria will present the aspect of a moving chess-
board, an ideal field for the military policy and
hold designs of the Seraskierat. In case of a
mobilisation not only will the powerful corps
posted in the regions that I have indicated
be called to the front, but in each of the six
segments between Aleppo and Gaza into
which Syria is divided, the Redifs (Reserve)
and Mustafiz (Landsturm) will be called to the
colours.
The region between the western loop of the
Euphrates and the Golf of Akaba contains
2,500,000 Moslems, and at the lowest com-
putation sixty thousand soldiers, once trained
in the Nizam (first line) and sprung from a
proud and warlike race that has distinguished
itself in all ages by courage on the field of
battle. With the divisions of Aleppo and
Damasons and reinforcements from Anatolia a
force of 150,OOO men could be massed in Syria—
a force composed of excellent material,fanatical,
brave, and well disciplined, which would like
nothing better than a campaign against
England* in Egypt, and the reconquest, from
the infidel whom they hate, of the ancient
province which they have lost but still regard
as the rampart to the Holy Cities of the
Moslem world. It may be urged that in the
recent campaign against the Imam Yehia
several regiments deserted to the rebel side,
but it must not be forgotten that they were
fighting Moslem foes, their brothers in race
and religion, and that face to face with the
extraordinary difficulties of the country they
may well have despaired of the success of a
campaign of repression undertaken with Bach
a lack of military essentials. But if these very
troops were fighting an infidel army with the
valley of the Nile as their prize, might not the
fervour of their faith and the artful appeals
of the Pan-Islamic party drive them on.
fanatical and irresistible, as one man to the
divinely ordained conquest of the City of
Victory
It follows from all this that the invading
army must be prevented from ever starting on
its march to Egypt. If it can once be con-
centrated and supplied with ammunition and
provisions, then, in my opinion, Egypt is lost.
The principle enounced in the opening para-
graph of this study leaps into light again. To
prevent an invasion mobilisation in Syria
must be rendered impossible. There are two
rotations of the problem and each will serve
as the Remedy- the neutralisation—or the
annexation-of Syria. At first sight they may
appear difficult, well-nigh impossible, but
though they seem big with consequences in
the near or the more distant future, though
they promise to perturb the political atmosphere
of the world, yet we may boldly affirm that
either is possible and that the clouds which,
through their employment, may darken the
sky will pass away without storm or danger.
Translator’s Note-The Turks and their panislamic sup-
porters regard England with increasing distrust and fear.
Recent incidents at koweit and on the Aden frontier have
intensified these emotions.

be remembered that the Prince passed through
here in the Print Heinrich on the 4th May
on his way to attend the wedding of the
Crown Prince of Germany as representative of
the Mikado. His Highness disembarked im-
mediately on arrival to-day,making several calls

FAYOUM LIGHT RAILWAY.
(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).
Medinet-el-Fayoum, Monday.
A Belgian company, which has been consi-
dering the question of purchasing the above-
mentioned railway, has sent two delegates to
FayoUm to go through the company’s books,
etc. Any intending purchasers of the line will
do well to make a thorough investigation not
only of the books but of the condition of the
line, stations, and rolling stock, before dosing
the bargain.

THE ST. HILDA
The crew' of the St. Hilda, the steamer which
was captured last month and sunk by the
Russians, reached Plymouth last Monday.
They appeared highly amused at the report
that a display of force by British warships
was necessary at Port Said to secure their
release from the Dnieper, on board which they
were kindly treated.

STEAMER MOVEMENTS.
The S.S. "Scottish Prince,” with passengers
and general cargo, left Manchester on Sunday,
and is due here,via Malta,on or about August 7.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
We do not hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expressed
by our correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play
to all, to permit - within certain necessary limits - free
discussion.

“HONOR TO WHOM, ETC."
TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.
Sir,—It is much to be regretted that some
of your contemporaries, instead of following
the example of the "Gazette” and confining
themselves to a bare account of the incident
that took place at the Eden Music-Hall on
the night of the French fete, have indulged
in attacks on Fire Brigade Superintendent
Lynn, while bis conduct on the occasion is
still under investigation. With regard to what
took place on the night of the 14th inst., I
will only say that one account of the assault
made upon Captain Lynn is confirmed by the
testimony of an eye-witness, and the enquiry
into the affair will, it is to be hoped, disclose
the truth.
But even supposing that the worst alleged
against Superintendent Lynn is tully proved,
and that his conduct was altogether unjustifi-
able, I would ask. Is the mistake of a single
night to be allowed to outweigh the many
years of valuable service, both military and
civil, rendered to this country by the gallant
captain  On the field of battle he has over
and over again proved himself to be a brave
and efficient officer; in his many contests with
the fiery element be has shown himself equally
fearless and skilful, and many an owner of
property in Alexandria has gratefully acknow-
ledged the value of his services. In the
United States also they were also greatly
appreciated, and Capt. Lynn possesses a medal
bestowed upon him by the late Pope for
saving the lib of an American Cardinal at a
fire in Boston. I trust that no remissness on
the part of his many friends will allow these
facts to be ignored by the authorities, and
that the great services rendered in the past
will not be permitted to escape their attention.
It is indeed surprising to find such a dead-
set made against a man occupying such a
position and holding such a record as Mr.
Lynn-I am, Sir, etc.,   THOS ATWOOD
