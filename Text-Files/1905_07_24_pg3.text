THE SELAMLIK OUTRAGE
AUTHOR REPORTED KILLED
BULGARIANIAN CONSPIRATORS.
Constantinople, July 22.
There were twenty-four killed, fifty-seven
injured, and Fifty-five horses injured by the
explosion of the bomb.	(Reuter.)
Constantinople, July 22.
It was while the Sultan was coming out of
the mosque that the bomb exploded. There
were 40 killed, Turks or soldiers, but no
foreigners. The Sultan returned to the Palace
with absolute composure. The author of the
outrage is said to have been killed. (Havas.)
Constantinople, July 22.
At the last moment it is said that the num-
ber of victims is 44 killed, 57 wounded, and
55 horses injured. The authors of the outrage
are said to be Bulgarians.	(Havas.)
Paris, July 22.
The President of the Republic and the
President of the Council telegraphed their
congratulations to the Sultan after the attempt
on his life.	(Havas.)
NATIVE PRESS COMMENTS
("Al Ahram”)
We were horrified to hear by cable that his
Majesty the Sultan—whom God preserve-
had been attacked during his return from the
ceremony of the Selamlik. But by his Majesty’s
well-known good fortune he escaped uninjured
and we congratulate him on his escape from the
dangerous toils of a conspiracy. We hear that
the Sultan displayed the usual composure and
courage which are the attributes of Turkish
Sultans on occasions of terror and dismay.
With every good and honest Osmanli we con-
gratulate his Majesty on his escape and con-
demn the miscreants who are responsible for
this nefarions attempt.
(“Al Moayad")
We find it difficult to believe the shocking
information of the attack on our beloved
Sultan,as the courtyard of the mosque is always
full of guards, officers of the army, aides-de-
camp, and soldiers, and all the necessary
precautionary measures to deter evil-doers from
entering are usually taken and all suspected
persona who bear the marks of guilt are prompt-
ly arrested and tried. How can the guilty
wretch in the face of such precautionary
measures have dared to bring a dynamite bomb
to the Selamlik and hurl it at the Ruler as he
left the mosque  He most have been a
desperate character ready to sacrifice his own
life. We are not surprised to hear that many
arrests have been made,as the incident is most
dangerous to the world....... The Turkish
Government is the most cautions in guarding
against the occurrence of such incidents. May
God save the Commander of the Faithful from
all harm and enable him to repress the foes of
his Government
("Al Lewa")
Our readers will have read the telegrams that
announced the preservation of our beloved
Sultan by the will of Heaven from an abomina-
ble attempt on his life. We were glad to be able
to despatch the following telegram to H.E. Tah-
sin Pasha, Chief Secretary ofthe Mabain:—
“We,the staff of’Al Lews,and all theMoslems
of Egypt beg you to deign to inform our beloved
Khalif of our joy at his escape. We pray
Heaven to give him long life and to crush and
exact punishment from the enemies of Islam."
“Al Lews” inserts the text of numerous
telegrams from Egyptian notables professing
their joy at the escape of the Sultan and
offering their congratulations on his preserva-
tion from harm.

The "Pall Mall Gazette” says The dinner
of the Anglo-Egyptian Army, which coincided
in date with that given by the Army and Navy
Club to the Duke of Connaught, was, like it, a
very remarkable gathering. Admiral Lucas,
V.C, ably presided at the last-named, Sir
Reginald Wingate over the former, and was
supported by Sir Evelyn Wood, Sir John
Maxwell, and a number of distinguished offi-
cers who made their career in Egypt Lord
Kitchener being, of course, unavoidably absent
Time was when service in Egypt was the only
outlet for the adventurous, and numbers came
to the front there whose names have become
household words. None has risen so fast or so
high as Sir Reginald Wingate, to whom we
owe no small portion of the ultimate establish
ment of British power in the Sudan. Since he
became Governor General Wingate has worked
little less than a miracle in the Sudan. He
has abolished "backsheesh," and that is no
small achievement He had made up his mind
that the practice which had taken such a hold
in Lower Egypt was a disgrace and a discredit
to the country, and he set himself at once to
forbid it in the Sudan. Orders were issued to
the police to arrest summarily all and singular
who made the conventional appeal, and nothing
strikes travellers to Khartoum more nowadays
than that the hateful word backsheesh is
never heard.
ARMY EXAMINATIONS.
The Army Orders issued from the Khartoum
Head Quarters on July 16 give the results
of the examination held last month by
which thirty non-commissioned officers and
men have qualified for promotion to the
rank of Wokala Bulakat Omana.
In publishing these results El Lewa St
George C. Henry Pasha, Adjutant General,
remarks that he wishes to bring to notice
the very creditable results obtained by can-
didates from the battalion schools of the 1st
Battalion and 13th Sudanese, the former pro-
viding four and the latter six successful candi-
dates trained in their own battalions.
BELGIAN DINNER
On Saturday last the recently-formed Bel-
gian Club gave a most pleasant and successful
dinner at the San Stefano Casino. The Belgian
Consul presided over the function, at which
the whole Belgian colony was present The
proceedings were marked by great cordiality,
and the arrangements, which were left in M.
Landaner’s capable hands, were universally
praised. Only pressure on our space prevents
us from giving the text of the brief but elo-
quent speech of M. Modesse, secretary to the
club.

Judge G. S. Batcheller, American judge in
the Mixed Court of Appeal, has just been
honored with a private audience of Pope
Pius X. The audience was arranged by Cardinal
Vinoerro Vannutelli, and lasted nearly an hour.
The Pope expressed great pleasure at meet-
ing an American official, and spoke feelingly
of his interest in the Church in America, and
with gratitude respecting the attitude of the
Government of the United States toward the
Catholic clergy.
He expressed personal gratification at re-
ceiving Judge Batcheller, being the third
pontiff to accord to him a special audience, the
judge having been similarly honored by Pius
IX. the year before his death, and by Leo XIII.
in 1895.

ceremony the bridal party drove to Lowther

Southampton, kindly placed at their disposal
by Mr. A. St George Caulfield.

COTTON GAMBLING IN EGYPT. 
QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.
The following printed questions and answers
in regard to cotton prices were issued in
Saturday week’s Parliamentary papers :—
Mr. Field asked the First Lord of the
Treasury whether, in view of the opinion ex-
pressed by Lord Cromer, as stated b his
official report for 1904 on gambling in futures
and options on the bourses of Egypt, in con-
junction with the resolution passed at the
International Cotton Congress at Manchester
on the 9th inst, he would consider the advis-
ability of the Government instructing His
Majesty’s representatives in Egypt, who are at
present sitting as members of the International
Judicial Congress on the question of gambling
in futures in that country, to advocate repres-
sive international legislative measures for the
joint benefit of Egypt and of manufacturers,
operatives, and users ; and whether he would
give instructions that the official proceedings
of the International Cotton Congress recently
held b Manchester, and also those of the
International Agricultural Con great lately held
in Rome, should be published b Blue-book
form, in the same way as Lord Cromer’s report
on Egypt was published.
Mr. Balfour replied: The hon. gentleman
has, I think, misapprehended the view ex-
pressed by Lord Cromer in his official report
for 1904, as the following passage will show
"On the other band, most authorities hold the
opinion, in which I venture to express my
entire concurrence, that it is practically im-
possible, by legislation, to put a stop to specu-
lation without at the same time causing great
hindrance to trade in general If anything is
done, it will probably be in the direction of
preparing a 'reglement de bonne’....." In
view hereof and of the fact that the resolution
of the International Cotton Congress merely
suggested certain technical alterations of trade
practice, I do not think it would be expedient
to act on the suggestion of the hon. gentle-
man. I have no right to give any instructions
as to the publication of the proceedings of the
International Cotton Congress, which is an un-
official body, and as to the publication of the
proceedings of the recent International Agri-
cultural Congress, perhaps the hon. gentleman
will consult the President of the Board of
Agriculture.
Mr. Field asked the First Lord of the
Treasury whether he is aware that, owing to
the actions of the bears in Liverpool and in
America, forcing down the price of cotton after
the Sully collapse in 1904 from 9d. per pound
to the low price of 4d., the Southern Planters
Cotton Association have entered into a com-
pact with the exchange gamblers of the latter
country to reduce the acreage of cotton for
1905-6 by about 25 per cent, and that specu-
lative advances have recently been operated in
options and futures on the Liverpool and the
United States cotton exchanges, to the detri-
ment of the Lancashire cotton industry, and
likewise to the world’s cotton trade generally ;
whether he would, in view of such artificial
conditions, appoint a special commission to
inquire into and report upon transactions in-
juriously affecting international trade ; and
whether he would confer with President Roose-
velt with the object of adopting some inter-
national cooperative endeavour in order to
prevent a repetition of these international
gambling operations in the shape of paper
sales of fictitious products through option and
future contracts.
Mr. Balfour replied : I am informed that no
inch compact is known to the Board of Trade,
and its existence seems rather improbable.
The price of cotton has recently advanced in
consequence, as I am told, of the unexpectedly
low official estimate of the coming crop. It is
not proposed to take the steps suggested by
the hon. gentleman.
HE ONE PROMENADE.
To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
Dear Sir,— The public very justly thinks
it hard lines that the only road on which
everyone must take the air, either in
arabiehs and motors or on bikes, quadrupeds,
etc., should be subject to agricultural stenches
of the worst description. If the members of the
Municipality had noses they could not drive out
to Ramleh without being perpetually sickened,
especially when the wind is from the Canal
Is it absolutely necessary for the welfare of the
proprietors, who are probably related to
members of the Municipality, that these heaps
of offensive material should be left for months
on top of the land and not be buried below the
surface  If we are to consider ourselves a
civilised community let us preserve the one
road allowed us for our afternoon drive, devoid
of such Oriental barbarities.—Faithfully yours,
A Woman with a Nose.
